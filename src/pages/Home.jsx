                My passion for technology started when I studied electronics at
                the age of 18, where I built robots and electric circuits using
                Arduino. From there, my love for software development grew as I
                started experimenting with various technologies and coding
                languages. I even built my own Doom-like video game and
                documented the whole process in an amateur blog I coded with
                basic knowledge. I didn't even noticed I had started my career
                in front-end development with that blog. But I certainly loved
                every second I spent working on it.

                Lastly an automatic graph that shows the genders and status of
                the characters. I used that info to show the mortality rate of
