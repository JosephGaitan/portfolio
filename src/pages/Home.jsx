                  My passion for technology started when I studied electronics
                  at the age of 18, where I built robots and electric circuits
                  using Arduino. From there, my love for software development
                  grew as I started experimenting with various technologies and
                  coding languages. I even built my own Doom-like video game and
                  documented the whole process in an amateur blog I coded with
                  basic knowledge. I didn't even noticed I had started my career
                  in front-end development with that blog. But I certainly loved
                  every second I spent working on it.
